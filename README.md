# Custom WPF Task Progress Dialog Control

A custom WPF control to create a **tasks-list style progress dialog**, inspired by Windows 7/wyUpdate with animated progress, state icons, and clear status for each operation.

Here's the classic inspiration:

![tasklist](img/tasklist.png)

---

## Purpose

This control is designed for modern WPF applications that need to show progress over multiple sequential (or parallel) tasks, with a user-friendly, visually clear, and instantly recognizable interface.

It replicates the familiar software update dialogs, featuring:
- Task checklists with animated or static state icons
- A progress bar for total completion
- Support for *Idle*, *Pending*, *Loading*, *Warning*, *Error*, and *Completed* visual states
- Full control from C#, PowerShell, or XAML code-behind

---

## Features

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Per-task status icons**: pause, spinner, tick, warning, error, idle
- üîÑ **Animated spinner** for in-progress tasks
- üü© **Green checkmark** for completed tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** and ‚ùå **Error** states for problematic tasks
- ‚ùí **Idle** state for tasks not yet started
- üìù **Easily controlled** from both code and XAML
- üñ•Ô∏è **Lightweight**‚Äîno dependencies except .NET/WPF

## Visual States

![states](img/states.gif)

Each task can display one of the following states:

### Idle

![idle](img/idle.png)

**Description:** The task is ready to start or has not yet started.

---

### Pending

![pending](img/pending.png)

**Description:** The task is scheduled and waiting to be processed (pause icon).

---

### Warning

![warning](img/warning.png)

**Description:** The task encountered a warning (‚ö†Ô∏è). Execution may continue, but user attention may be required.

---

### Error

![error](img/error.png)

**Description:** The task has failed (‚ùå). User or program intervention is required.

---

### Loading

![loading](img/loading.png)

**Description:** The task is currently running, with an animated spinner.

---

### Completed

![completed](img/completed.png)

**Description:** The task completed successfully (green checkmark).

---

## Usage

Add your control to any WPF window or dialog and set each task's status from your code (C#, PowerShell, etc):

```csharp
// C# Example
myExtensionItem.Status = ExtensionStatus.Loading;
myExtensionItem.ExtensionLabel = "Downloading update...";



## PowerShell Test & Integration Functions

The project includes a set of **PowerShell helper functions** (see `Show-TestDialog.ps1`) for rapid development, testing, and automation scenarios. These scripts allow you to load your compiled control, verify assembly registration, and interactively demo all visual states.

### Functions

#### `Get-ExtensionControlDllPath`

Searches for your compiled control DLL in Debug/Release output directories, supporting both targeted and "Any" configurations.
Returns the path of the first matching assembly found.

#### `Register-ExtensionControlDll`

Loads the compiled WPF control assembly into the current PowerShell session (if not already loaded), ensuring all .NET types are available for use.
Handles Debug/Release/Any modes automatically.

#### `Test-ExtensionControlLoaded`

Checks if the control's types (like `[WebExtensionPack.Controls.ExtensionStatus]`) are already loaded in the current session.
Returns `$True` or `$False`.

#### `Show-ExtensionItemDialog`

Launches a test dialog window containing a single `ExtensionItem` control and a button to cycle through all available states (`Idle`, `Pending`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Loading`, `Completed`).

* Dynamically updates the control‚Äôs icon and label.
* Lets you visually verify every UI state in real time.

**Example usage:**

```powershell
. .\Show-TestDialog.ps1
Show-ExtensionItemDialog
```

## Registering Scripts Dependenvies

We are all a little bit lazy, and so when we ride the fine line between having clean, separated scripts by types and be able to include all the scripts quickly...
We use a command that will source all the scripts in one go, without merging the scripts in one ugly file. [like this](img/deps2.png)
```powershell 
·∂ú·µí ≥·µâ‚Å∑C:\Dev\WpfCtrl-ExtensionItem>.\scripts\Register-Dependencies.ps1 

  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Get-ExtensionControlDllPath.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Get-WpfExtensionCtrl.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Register-Control.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Show-TestDialog.ps1
```

If there's a error in one of the script, you will get a notification [like this](img/error_details.png)

```powershell
·∂ú·µí ≥·µâ‚Å∑C:\Dev\WpfCtrl-ExtensionItem> .\scripts\Register-Dependencies.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Get-ExtensionControlDllPath.ps1
  ‚ùå Found Error                        Get-WpfExtensionCtrl.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Register-Control.ps1
  ‚úîÔ∏è successfully sourced       Show-TestDialog.ps1
  ```

The ```ErrorDetails``` argument can be used to go through all the errors and list the stack and details...:
